# Stegnography
This project is done in VMWARE interface, the main intention of the project is to encrypt the privacy content in audio and video using cryptographic techniques
# For the Breif Project introduction
Steganography, an ancient practice dating back to ancient Greece and Rome, has 
seen a resurgence in modern times as a crucial component of data security 
strategies. With the increasing prevalence of digital communication and the 
need for secure transmission of sensitive information, steganography offers a 
covert means of hiding data within seemingly innocuous files, such as images, 
audio, or video. 
In this project, we focus on implementing steganography using Linux, a popular 
open-source operating system known for its robustness and flexibility. By 
harnessing the power of Linux, we aim to provide a seamless and efficient 
method for embedding and extracting hidden data within digital images. 
Central to our implementation is the utilization of the steghide tool, a versatile 
steganography utility specifically designed for Linux platforms. Steghide 
employs sophisticated algorithms to embed confidential information within 
image files, ensuring that the visual appearance of the carrier remains virtually 
unchanged. This capability is crucial for maintaining the covert nature of the 
hidden data, as any perceptible alterations to the carrier file could potentially 
compromise the secrecy of the embedded message.
